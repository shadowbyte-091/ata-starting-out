# Test Repository

This is my very
 first
 Git repo.

Created as part of my
 software
 engineering
 tasks.

Git helps
 developers
 track changes
 in code.

Every file
 added here can
 be version
 controlled.

Commits act like
 checkpoints
 in a project.

Branches
 allow
 experimenting
 safely.

Merging
 combines
 different
 lines of work.

This repo
 marks the
 beginning of
 my journey. i would love to be a software engineer ti build my own software
