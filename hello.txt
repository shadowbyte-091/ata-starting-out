# Test Repository

This is my very
 first Git repo.

Created as part of my
 software engineering tasks.

Git helps developers
 track changes in code.

It allows collaboration
 with teammates.

Every file added here can
 be version controlled.

Commits act like
 checkpoints in a project.

Branches allow
 experimenting safely.

Merging combines
 different lines of work.

This repo marks the
 beginning of my journey.
